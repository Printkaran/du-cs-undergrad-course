## Linear Regression 

Predict Canada's per capita income in year 2020. There is an exercise folder here on github download that and you will find canada_per_capita_income.csv file. 
Using this build a regression model and predict the per capita income fo Canadian citizens in year 2020

## Linear Regression with multiple variables

In Github, there is a link for a dataset (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/codebasics/py/master/ML/2_linear_reg_multivariate/Exercise/hiring.csv). This file contains hiring statics for a firm such as experience of candidate, his written test score and personal interview score. Based on these 3 factors, HR will decide the salary. Given this data, you need to build a machine learning model for HR department that can help them decide salaries for future candidates. Using this predict salaries for following candidates,
**1. 2 yr experience, 9 test score, 6 interview score**
**2. 12 yr experience, 10 test score, 10 interview score**
