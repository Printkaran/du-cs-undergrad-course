## List of Practicals

*(Use Python debugger tool-pydb and PythonTutor for debugging where ever required.)*

1. Write a function that takes the lengths of three sides: *side1*, *side2* and *side3* of the triangle as the input from the user using  input function and return the area and perimeter of the triangle as a tuple. Also, assert that sum of the length of any two sides is greater than the third side.

2. Consider a showroom of electronic products, where there are various salesmen. Each salesman is given a commission of 5%, depending on the sales made per month. In case the sale done is less than 50000, then the salesman is not given any commission. Write a function to calculate total sales of a salesman in a month, commission and remarks for the salesman. Sales done by each salesman per week is to be provided as input. Use tuples / list to store data of
salesmen.
Assign remarks according to the following criteria:

    - Excellent: Sales >=80000
    - Good: Sales>=60000 and <80000
    - Average: Sales>=40000 and <60000
    - Work Hard: Sales < 40000

3. Write a Python function to find the nth term of Fibonacci sequence and its
factorial. Return the result as a list.

4. Write a function that takes a number (>=10) as an input and return the digits of the number as a set.

5. Write a function that finds the sum of the n terms of the following series.
Import the factorial function created in question 4.
    
    **1 – x^2 /2! + x^4 /4! – x^6 /6! + … x^n /n!**

6. Consider a tuple *t1 ={1 ,2,5,7,9,2,4,6,8,1 0}*. Write a program to perform following operations:

    a) Print another tuple whose values are even numbers in the 
given tuple.

    b) Concatenate a tuple *t2={1 1 ,1 3,1 5}* with t1.

    c) Return maximum and minimum value from this tuple.

7. Write a menu driven program to perform the following on strings:

    a) Find the length of string.

    b) Return maximum of three strings.

    c) Accept a string and replace all vowels with “#”

    d) Find number of words in the given string.

    e) Check whether the string is a palindrome or not.

8. Write a Python program to perform the following using list:

    a) Check if all elements in list are numbers or not.

    b) If it is a numeric list, then count number of odd values in it.

    c) If list contains all Strings, then display largest String in the list.

    d) Display list in reverse form.

    e) Find a specified element in list

9. Use dictionary to store marks of the students in 4 subjects. Write a function to find the name of the student securing highest percentage. (Hint: Names of students are unique).

10. Write a function that takes a sentence as input from the user and calculates the frequency of each letter. Use a variable of dictionary type to maintain the count.

11. Write a menu-driven program to accept a list of student names and perform the following

    a. search an element using linear search/ binary search.

    b. Sort the elements using bubble sort/ insertion sort/ selection sort.

12. Write a program that makes use of a function to accept a list of n integers and displays a histogram.

13. Write a program that makes use of a function to display sine, cosine, polynomial and exponential curves.

14. Write a function that reads a file file1 and copies only alternative lines to another file file2. Alternative lines copied should be the odd numbered lines. Use Exception.

15. Define a class Student to store his/ her name and marks in three subjects. Use a class variable to store the maximum average marks of the class. Use constructor and destructor to initialize and destroy the objects.
